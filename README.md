StudentPerformancePrediction-ML
This project focuses on using machine learning classifiers to predict factors that influence student grades, based on a dataset stored in a CSV file.

The dataset includes information about students' nationalities, grade levels, and various influencing factors such as the number of hands raised, attendance, study hours, and more.

Several machine learning models and classifiers are employed to determine the most accurate predictions of the factors that affect students' performance.

Additionally, visual aids like graphs and confusion matrices are used to display and analyze the results.
